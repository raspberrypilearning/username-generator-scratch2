Real and imaginary animals and creatures work well in the `nouns` list. Try to think of unusual ones.

Here are some ideas for the `adjectives` list:

+ Metals: Zinc, Copper, Iron, Brass, Silver, Gold
+ Colours: Crimson, Aqua, Magenta, Golden, Indigo
+ Gemstones: Quartz, Emerald, Sapphire, Diamond
+ Habitats: Moon, Desert, Snow, Jungle, Forest, Space

Remember to hide the lists from the stage when testing your project.
