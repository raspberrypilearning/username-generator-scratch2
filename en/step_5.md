## Challenge: add a number

On popular websites and apps, it can be really hard to find a username that someone else isnâ€™t already using. Or you might find that the username you use on one site is already taken on other sites. To get around that, you could add a number to the end of your username. **Remember not to use your age, birth date, or birth year.**

Can you use the following blocks to generate usernames with a random number at the end?

```blocks
set [username v] to [0]

join [hello] [world]

username :: variables

pick random (20) to (99)
```

New usernames you generate should now have numbers at the end:
